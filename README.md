## Audiostr√∂m's Liveprofessor control with chataigne by OSC
Default ports are set to  8000 (OUT) and 8001 (IN). But this can be changed in the preferences of Liveprofessor!

I just started to write this module-script. So it is still totally "Work-in-Progress"...   
Please contact me if you have demands or requests and any help is always welcome !!

Have Fun
