## Audiostr√∂m's LiveProfessor control with chataigne and OSC
Default ports are set to  8000 (OUT) and 8001 (IN). But this can be changed in the preferences of LiveProfessor!

To "install" the module, just download the zipped file, than "unzip" the file and put the whole Folder in the "Chataigne modules" directory. You than will find the module in the Community-Modules in Chataigne (under "Plugin-Host")

### Actually  in Version 1.3 
You can change the number of the "Snapshot-Name-Fields" and also the number of shown  "Chains" ! If you change the number you must save the project (cmd-S) and reload it (cmd-shift-O).    
The field for Active-Snapshot and Active- and Next-Cue only show Names after any Shapshot or Cue-Action (can be : next, previous or call etc)

There are many Global OSC-Commandes within LiveProfessor, but the real power of the Remote-Function is that all can be mapped and tweaked as desired by individual mapping...!   
But this means also that the OSC-configuration (and its implementation) can change from one Session-File to another !    
On my [Github-Page](https://github.com/ziginfo/Liveprofessor-Chataigne-Module) you'll find a folder named Files with some additionnel stuff.  
A good starting point may be, to use my "Basic-Empty-Session" where some basic OSC-Commands are already mapped in ! If you wanna start from scratch you can also open a "New Project" and than import my "Basic-OSC-configuration.ctrl2" file which will give you already a basic OSC-Implementation !   
To do this, just download the file "Basic-OSC-configuration.ctrl2"; and import it to "Hardware Controller Setup" of LiveProfessor (see the screen captures) ... Note that you than have to mapp every single Controller to a given Function ! Once again : the Project-File "Basic_Empty.rack2" has already these controllers and some basic Function-Mappings.... (I'll update these Files also, while adding more functions in the future)     
Please contact me if you have demands or requests and any help is always welcome !!

Have Fun
